 * We have a lot of duplicate joystick names
   Also duplicate GUIDs are found for "different OSes"
   TODO: rework storage and searching for joystick records.
   Note: duplicate records seem to have identical layouts, only different GUIDs
   This way current "overwriting" of the equally named joysticks isn't a critical
   problem, however, it most certainly has to be fixed in the future
 * [CRITICAL] Note that in Windows we get a wrong reported joystick name as "Microsoft PC-joystick driver"
   while the joystick name reported by SDL2 is G-Shark GS-GP702 and the true name is Esperanza EG102
 * TJoyState has max 8 axes [0..7], however, database has as much as 14 axes
 * Windows and Linux backends handle axes in an ambiguous way,
   AxesMap tries to mimic something that this database should do,
   but eventually it does so only for one type of axes layout.
   Overall, currently this makes this database pretty useless.
   However, I'm not sure if our current backends return valid axes indexes,
   as we're using legacy backends both on Linux and Windows and
   axes layouts theoretically can be different from those provided by
   newer backends.
 * Data[0] is GUID and we can't use it at the moment, however, maybe we can get it from backend?
   In SDL it is used to detect the joystick
 * [TODO] Defatul X-Box like gamepad layout.
   Note, that currently we have Right stick flipped X and Y axes for X-Box gamepad,
   possibly due to AxesMap messing with original axes order,
   or original axes order reported wrong.
   (it is also possible, thou very unlikely, that it's fault of the
   database, as it does contain errors; however, not a single gamepad
   reports Y axis before X axis - Y axis always follows X axis, never preceeds,
   like we have now on X-Box layout)
 * What is the difference between ButtonPress and ButtonDown events?
   Looks like there is none on Linux, however, on Windows event ButtonDown
   fires constantly while the button is hold pressed, but ButtonPress
   only once, when the button is pressed.
 * Merge 2 git repositories preserving history:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories 
 * See also https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/master/src/joystick/SDL_gamecontroller.c
   (same thing done in SDL)
 * [BUG] Currently we do not send Axis=0 event (on Windows?), which is important for correct determination of joystick
   axes. We have to reliably send Axis=0 events for all possible axes (D-Pad included) in all backends.
   Or otherwise we have to update TCastleJoysticks every frame pooling joysticks data.
 * Use JoystickEpsilon always, including for axes.
 * [Critical] D-Pad events (and possibly other events, especially Fake events) generate wrong Release event!!!
 * Report unknown joystick event only once?
 * [TODO] Fake events
