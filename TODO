Phase - 1

 * Report unknown joystick event only once?
 * [TODO] Fake events
 * [TODO] No database for OS other than Windows, Linux will most likely result in compilation error or crash.
 * [TODO] Rename castleinternaljoystickrecord to castleinternaljoysticklayout

Phase - 2

 * [TODO] Merge 2 git repositories preserving history:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425892/how-do-you-merge-two-git-repositories 
 * [TODO] Integrate into Castle Game Engine (rewrite TJoysticks, TJoystick)
 * [TODO] Improve current backends
 * [CRITICAL] Windows and Linux backends handle axes in an ambiguous way,
   AxesMap tries to mimic something that this database should do,
   but eventually it does so only for one type of axes layout.
   Overall, currently this makes this database pretty useless.
   However, I'm not sure if our current backends return valid axes indexes,
   as we're using legacy backends both on Linux and Windows and
   axes layouts theoretically can be different from those provided by
   newer backends.
 * TJoyState has max 8 axes [0..7], however, database has as much as 14 axes
 * [TODO] Test X-Box controller

Phase - 3

 * [TODO] Rework backend
 * [TODO] DirectInput headers for FreePascal: http://www.clootie.ru/fpc/index.html
   Unfortunately they have MPL1.1 license, which is incompatible
 * [CRITICAL] Note that in Windows we get a wrong reported joystick name as "Microsoft PC-joystick driver"
   while the joystick name reported by SDL2 is G-Shark GS-GP702 and the true name is Esperanza EG102
 * [BUG?] Currently we do not send Axis=0 event (on Windows?), which is important for correct determination of joystick
   axes. We have to reliably send Axis=0 events for all possible axes (D-Pad included) in all backends.
   Or otherwise we have to update TCastleJoysticks every frame pooling joysticks data.
